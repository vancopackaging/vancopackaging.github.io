<!--
## Background ##

Parents, educators and health professionals are concerned about the length of
time that today's children are exposed to electronic devices. However, the 
recreational and educational potential of the iPhone and iPad make it a favorite
of parents and children. Screen Time is a simple solution to help set and 
control limits to your children's interaction with an iPhone or iPad.

Now, you can revel in the fact that you are providing good boundaries for using 
technology.

## Using Screen Time ##

Screen Time is a simple app that allows you to set limits on the amount of time 
you children use an iPhone or iPad. Set a time length, press start and pass it 
to you children. After the time expires, a series of notifications will prevent 
your children from using the device until you enter the correct passcode.

## Settting a User and Starting a Session ##
1. Drag your finger horizontally across the numbers to set the time
2. Set the user by tapping on user names in the upper left of the screen.  You 
    will be prompted to add a user name before beginning the first run.
4. Press "Start"
5. Pass your iPhone or iPad to your child and let them use the phone any way 
   you choose (e.g. apps, movies, music).  
6. Screen Time runs in background and keeps track of how much time has expired.

## Monitor Time Remaining ##
You can get an approximation of how much time is remaining in the current session
by switching to multi-tasking mode in iOS 7.

1. Double-click the 'Home' button on the device to display recently used apps.
2. Screen Time will show you the minutes remaining on the application screenshot.
3. The background color changes to provide a visual cue to younger users who can not
   yet read or tell time.  
    * Green Background: More than 5 minutes remaining
    * Orange Background: Less than 5 minutes
    * Red Background: Less than 2 minutes


## Notifications and Alerts ##
After your predetermined time, a series of alerts and notification will play 
alerting the child (and you) that their screen time is up.

* A single notification will be posted to Notification Center to all devices 
    that share an iCloud account (e.g. iPhone, iPad, Mac Book Pro, Mac Pro).
    You will be prompted to grant access to your Calendar when the application
    first launches to use this feature.  You can update this preference in Settings.
* Continous notifications will be presented on the device (similar to text 
    messages).  This will temporarily disrupt the child's activity on the device.
    Notifications continue to fire even in they child taps 'Cancel'.
    *For best results (e.g. the most disruptive to the child), change the
    notification types to 'Alert' style using iOS' Setting.app.*
* A siren will sound
* The camera's flash will fire when on the passcode screen


## Ending a Session ##
The notifications and siren will continue to fire until the correct passcode 
is entered;

1. Launch Screen Time.  You can launch it directly from a notification by tapping
    on it.
2. Enter your passcode to stop all the notifications.  The first time you use 
    Screen Time on a device, you will be prompted to set a passcode.  You can 
    change the passcode at any time in the 'Settings' screen in the application.



<hr>
## Data Syncing With iCloud ##
Screen Time uses iCloud to sync data between devices.  This allows you to monitor
your child's screen time between devices.  This also allows Screen Time to deliver
notifications when a session ends to all your devices, including laptop and desktop
computers.

All user names and session data is synced between devices.  Please note, passcodes
 are not synced between devices, you will need to enter one per device.  You may 
 use the same passcode across
devices.


<hr>
## User Managment ##
To assist with understaning and managing your children's screen time, the application
allows you to set up users so you can track different users on the save device.

* When launching your first session, you will be prompted to provide a user name.
* You may add/remove users in the Settings screen.  Be advised that when you delete 
 a user, all their session data will be removed.
* User names are synced between device using iCloud.
